## Building the SDK

To build the SDK and see changes, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

2. Install dependencies using yarn:

     ```bash
     yarn

2. Build the SDK:

    ```bash
    yarn build

## Experimenting with SDK Methods
## Demo Methods
Once the SDK is built, you can experiment with the provided methods.

To experiment the SDK locally, a connection is required a existing CORD network. 
It is also possible to run a CORD network locally. 
Please follow the documentation mentioned at [CORD](https://github.com/dhiway/cord) repository.



## Statement Method:

The `demo-statement` method allows you to interact with statement-related functionalities.

To run the statement demo, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn demo-statement
```

## Network Score Method:

The `demo-network-score` method demonstrates methods related to network scores.

To run the network score demo, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn demo-network-score
```

## Asset Method:

The `demo-asset` method showcases methods related to assets.

To run the asset demo, execute the following command:

```bash

```

## Entries Method:

The `demo-registry-entries` method showcases methods related to entries.

To run the asset demo, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn demo-registry-entries
```


The output of each demo script will demonstrate the functionality of the corresponding method. For a detailed structure of the demo scripts, refer to the source code.

## Consuming the SDK in Your Project

To use the SDK in your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory.

2. Install the SDK using npm or yarn:
